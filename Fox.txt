4980 ""
4980 "Pray who is there who would refuse"
4980 "To bearer be of happy news?"
4980 "          ??_Old Granny Fox_."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Snow covered the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and ice bound the"
4980 "Smiling Pool and the Laughing Brook. Reddy and Granny Fox were hungry"
4980 "most of the time. It was not easy to find enough to eat these days, and"
4980 "so they spent nearly every minute they were awake in hunting. Sometimes"
4980 "they hunted together, but usually one went one way, and the other went"
4980 "another way so as to have a greater chance of finding something. If"
4980 "either found enough for two, the one finding it took the food back to"
4980 "their home if it could be carried. If not, the other was told where to"
4980 "find it."
4980 ""
4980 "For several days they had had very little indeed to eat, and they were"
4980 "so hungry that they were willing to take almost any chance to get a"
4980 "good meal. For two nights they had visited Farmer Brown??s henhouse,"
4980 "hoping that they would be able to find a way inside. But the biddies"
4980 "had been securely locked up, and try as they would, they couldn??t find"
4980 "a way in."
4980 ""
4980 "??It??s of no use,?? said Granny, as they started back home after the"
4980 "second try, ??to hope to get one of those hens at night. If we are going"
4980 "to get any at all, we will have to do it in broad daylight. It can be"
4980 "done, for I have done it before, but I don??t like the idea. We are"
4980 "likely to be seen, and that means that Bowser the Hound will be set to"
4980 "hunting us.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??Pooh!?? exclaimed Reddy. ??What of it? It??s easy enough to fool him.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??You think so, do you??? snapped Granny. ??I never yet saw a young Fox"
4980 "who didn??t think he knew all there is to know, and you??re just like the"
4980 "rest. When you??ve lived as long as I have you will have learned not to"
4980 "be quite so sure of your own opinions. I grant you that when there is"
4980 "no snow on the ground, any Fox with a reasonable amount of Fox sense in"
4980 "his head can fool Bowser, but with snow everywhere it is a very"
4980 "different matter. If Bowser once takes it into his head to follow your"
4980 "trail these days, you will have to be smarter than I think you are to"
4980 "fool him. The only way you will be able to get away from him will be by"
4980 "going into a hole in the ground, and when you do that you will have"
4980 "given away a secret that will mean we will never have any peace at all."
4980 "We will never know when Farmer Brown??s boy will take it into his head"
4980 "to smoke us out. I??ve seen it done. No, Sir, we are not going to try"
4980 "for one of those hens in the daytime unless we are starving.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??I??m starving now,?? whined Reddy."
4980 ""
4980 "??No such thing!?? Granny snapped. ??I??ve been without food longer than"
4980 "this many a time. Have you been over to the Big River lately???"
4980 ""
4980 "??No,?? replied Reddy. ??What??s the use? It??s frozen over. There isn??t"
4980 "anything there.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??Perhaps not,?? replied Granny, ??but I learned a long time ago that it"
4980 "is a poor plan to overlook any chance. There is a place in the Big"
4980 "River which never freezes because the water runs too swiftly to freeze,"
4980 "and I??ve found more than one meal washed ashore there. You go over"
4980 "there now while I see what I can find in the Green Forest. If neither"
4980 "of us finds anything, it will be time enough to think about Farmer"
4980 "Brown??s hens to-morrow.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Much against his will Reddy obeyed. ??It isn??t the least bit of use,?? he"
4980 "grumbled, as he trotted towards the Big River. ??There won??t be anything"
4980 "there. It is just a waste of time.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Late that afternoon he came hurrying back, and Granny knew by the way"
4980 "that he cocked his ears and carried his tail that he had news of some"
4980 "kind. ??Well, what is it??? she demanded."
4980 ""
4980 "??I found a dead fish that had been washed ashore,?? replied Reddy. ??It"
4980 "wasn??t big enough for two, so I ate it.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??Anything else??? asked Granny."
4980 ""
4980 "??No-o,?? replied Reddy slowly; ??that is, nothing that will do us any"
4980 "good. Quacker the Wild Duck was swimming about out in the open water,"
4980 "but though I watched and watched he never once came ashore.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??Ha!?? exclaimed Granny. ??That _is_ good news. I think we??ll go Duck"
4980 "hunting.??"

4980 "Granny And Reddy Fox Go Hunting"
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "When you??re in doubt what course is right,"
4980 "The thing to do is just sit tight."
4980 "          ??_Old Granny Fox_."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun had just got well started on his daily"
4980 "climb up in the blue, blue sky that morning when he spied two figures"
4980 "trotting across the snow-covered Green Meadows, one behind the other."
4980 "They were trotting along quite as if they had made up their minds just"
4980 "where they were going. They had. You see they were Granny and Reddy"
4980 "Fox, and they were bound for the Big River at the place where the water"
4980 "ran too swiftly to freeze. The day before Reddy had discovered Quacker"
4980 "the Wild Duck swimming about there, and now they were on their way to"
4980 "try to catch him."
4980 ""
4980 "Granny led the way and Reddy meekly followed her. To tell the truth,"
4980 "Reddy hadn??t the least idea that they would have a chance to catch"
4980 "Quacker, because Quacker kept out in the water where he was as safe"
4980 "from them as if they were a thousand miles away. The only reason that"
4980 "Reddy had willingly started with Granny was the hope that he might find"
4980 "a dead fish washed up on the shore as he had the day before."
4980 ""
4980 "??Granny certainly is growing foolish in her old age,?? thought Reddy, as"
4980 "he trotted along behind her. ??I told her that Quacker never once came"
4980 "ashore all the time I watched yesterday. I don??t believe he _ever_"
4980 "comes ashore, and if she knows anything at all she ought to know that"
4980 "she can??t catch him out there in the water. Granny used to be smart"
4980 "enough when she was young, I guess, but she certainly is losing her"
4980 "mind now. It??s a pity, a great pity. I can just imagine how Quacker"
4980 "will laugh at her. I have to laugh myself.??"
4980 ""
4980 "He did laugh, but you may be sure he took great pains that Granny"
4980 "should not see him laughing. Whenever she looked around he was as sober"
4980 "as could be. In fact, he appeared to be quite as eager as if he felt"
4980 "sure they would catch Quacker. Now old Granny Fox is very wise in the"
4980 "ways of the Great World, and if Reddy could have known what was going"
4980 "on in her mind as she led the way to the Big River, he might not have"
4980 "felt quite so sure of his own smartness. Granny was doing some quiet"
4980 "laughing herself."
4980 ""
4980 "??He thinks I??m old and foolish and don??t know what I??m about, the young"
4980 "scamp!?? thought she. ??He thinks he has learned all there is to learn."
4980 "It isn??t the least use in the world to try to tell him anything. When"
4980 "young folks feel the way he does, it is a waste of time to talk to"
4980 "them. He has got to be shown. There is nothing like experience to take"
4980 "the conceit out of these youngsters.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Now conceit is the feeling that you know more than any one else."
4980 "Perhaps you do. Then again, perhaps you don??t. So sometimes it is best"
4980 "not to be too sure of your own opinion. Reddy was sure. He trotted"
4980 "along behind old Granny Fox and planned smart things to say to her when"
4980 "she found that there wasn??t a chance to catch Quacker the Duck. I am"
4980 "afraid, very much afraid, that Reddy was planning to be saucy. People"
4980 "who think themselves smart are quite apt to be saucy."
4980 ""
4980 "Presently they came to the bank of the Big River. Old Granny Fox told"
4980 "Reddy to sit still while she crept up behind some bushes where she"
4980 "could peek out over the Big River. He grinned as he watched her. He was"
4980 "still grinning when she tiptoed back. He expected to see her face long"
4980 "with disappointment. Instead she looked very much pleased."
4980 ""
4980 "??Quacker is there,?? said she, ??and I think he will make us a very good"
4980 "dinner. Creep up behind those bushes and see for yourself, then come"
4980 "back here and tell me what you think we??d better do to get him.??"
4980 ""
4980 "So Reddy stole up behind the bushes, and this time it was Granny who"
4980 "grinned as she watched. As he crept along, Reddy wondered if it could"
4980 "be that for once Quacker had come ashore. Granny seemed so sure they"
4980 "could catch him that this must be the case. But when he peeped through"
4980 "the hushes, there was Quacker way out in the middle of the open water"
4980 "just where he had been the day before."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "<CHAPTER III>"
4980 "Reddy Is Sure Granny Has Lost Her Senses"
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Perhaps ??tis just as well that we"
4980 "Can??t see ourselves as others see."
4980 "          ??_Old Granny Fox_."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "??Just as I thought,?? muttered Reddy Fox as he peeped through the bushes"
4980 "on the bank of the Big River and saw Quacker swimming about in the"
4980 "water where it ran too swiftly to freeze. ??We??ve got just as much"
4980 "chance of catching him as I have of jumping over the moon. That??s what"
4980 "I??ll tell Granny.??"
4980 ""
4980 "He crept back carefully so as not to be seen by Quacker, and when he"
4980 "had reached the place where Granny was waiting for him, his face wore a"
4980 "very impudent look."
4980 ""
4980 "??Well,?? said Granny Fox, ??what shall we do to catch him???"
4980 ""
4980 "??Learn to swim like a fish and fly like a bird,?? replied Reddy in such"
4980 "a saucy tone that Granny had hard work to keep from boxing his ears."
4980 ""
4980 "??You mean that you think he can??t be caught??? said she quietly."
4980 ""
4980 "??I don??t think anything about it; I _know_ he can??t!?? snapped Reddy."
4980 "??Not by us, anyway,?? he added."
4980 ""
4980 "??I suppose you wouldn??t even try??? retorted Granny."
4980 ""
4980 "??I??m old enough to know when I??m wasting my time,?? replied Reddy with a"
4980 "toss of his head."
4980 ""
4980 "??In other words you think I??m a silly old Fox who has lost her senses,??"
4980 "said Granny sharply."
4980 ""
4980 "??No-o. I didn??t say that,?? protested Reddy, looking very uncomfortable."
4980 ""
4980 "??But you think it,?? declared Granny. ??Now look here, Mr. Smarty, you do"
4980 "just as I tell you. You creep back there where you can watch Quacker"
4980 "and all that happens, and mind that you keep out of his sight. Now go.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy went. There was nothing else to do. He didn??t dare disobey."
4980 "Granny watched until Reddy had readied his hiding-place. Then what do"
4980 "you think she did? Why, she walked right out on the little beach just"
4980 "below Reddy and in plain sight of Quacker! Yes, Sir, that is what she"
4980 "did!"
4980 ""
4980 "Then began such a queer performance that it is no wonder that Reddy was"
4980 "sure Granny had lost her senses. She rolled over and over. She chased"
4980 "her tail round and round until it made Reddy dizzy to watch her. She"
4980 "jumped up in the air. She raced back and forth. She played with a bit"
4980 "of stick. And all the time she didn??t pay the least attention to"
4980 "Quacker the Duck."
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy stared and stared. Whatever had come over Granny? She was crazy."
4980 "Yes, Sir, that must be the matter. It must be that she had gone without"
4980 "food so long that she had gone crazy. Poor Granny! She was in her"
4980 "second childhood. Reddy could remember how he had done such things when"
4980 "he was very young, just by way of showing how fine he felt. But for a"
4980 "grown-up Fox to do such things was undignified, to say the least. You"
4980 "know Reddy thinks a great deal of dignity. It was worse than"
4980 "undignified; it was positively disgraceful. He did hope that none of"
4980 "his neighbors would happen along and see Granny cutting up so. He never"
4980 "would hear the end of it if they did."
4980 ""
4980 "Over and over rolled Granny, and around and around she chased her tail."
4980 "The snow flew up in a cloud. And all the time she made no sound. Reddy"
4980 "was just trying to decide whether to go off and leave her until she had"
4980 "regained her common sense, or to go out and try to stop her, when he"
4980 "happened to look out in the open water where Quacker was. Quacker was"
4980 "sitting up as straight as he could. In fact, he had his wings raised to"
4980 "help him sit up on his tail, the better to see what old Granny Fox was"
4980 "doing."
4980 ""
4980 "??As I live,?? muttered Reddy, ??I believe that fellow is nearer than he"
4980 "was!??"
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy crouched lower than ever, and instead of watching Granny he"
4980 "watched Quacker the Duck."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "<CHAPTER IV>"
4980 "Quacker The Duck Grows Curious"
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "The most curious thing in the world is curiosity."
4980 "          ??_Old Granny Fox_."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Old Granny Fox never said a truer thing than that. It is curious, very"
4980 "curious, how sometimes curiosity will get the best of even the wisest"
4980 "and most sensible of people. Even Old Granny Fox herself has been known"
4980 "to be led into trouble by it. We expect it of Peter Rabbit, but Peter"
4980 "isn??t a bit more curious than some others of whom we do not expect it."
4980 ""
4980 "Now Quacker the Wild Duck is the last one in the world you would expect"
4980 "to be led into trouble by curiosity. Quacker had spent the summer in"
4980 "the Far North with Honker the Goose. In fact, he had been born there."
4980 "He had started for the far away Southland at the same time Honker had,"
4980 "but when he reached the Big River he had found plenty to eat and had"
4980 "decided to stay until he had to move on. The Big River had frozen over"
4980 "everywhere except in this one place where the water was too swift to"
4980 "freeze, and there Quacker had remained. You see, he was a good diver"
4980 "and on the bottom of the river he found plenty to eat. No one could get"
4980 "at him out there, unless it were Roughleg the Hawk, and if Roughleg did"
4980 "happen along, all he had to do was to dive and come up far away to"
4980 "laugh and make fun of Roughleg. The water couldn??t get through his oily"
4980 "feathers, and so he didn??t mind how cold it was."
4980 ""
4980 "Now in his home in the Far North there were so many dangers that"
4980 "Quacker had early learned to be always on the watch and to take the"
4980 "best of care of himself. On his way down to the Big River he had been"
4980 "hunted by men with terrible guns, and he had learned all about them. In"
4980 "fact, he felt quite able to keep out of harm??s way. He rather prided"
4980 "himself that there was no one smart enough to catch him."
4980 ""
4980 "I suspect he thought he knew all there was to know. In this respect he"
4980 "was a good deal like Reddy Fox himself. That was because he was young."
4980 "It is the way with young Ducks and Foxes and with some other youngsters"
4980 "I know."
4980 ""
4980 "When Quacker first saw Granny Fox on the little beach, he flirted his"
4980 "absurd little tail and smiled as he thought how she must wish she could"
4980 "catch him. But so far as he could see, Granny didn??t once look at him."
4980 ""
4980 "??She doesn??t know I??m out here at all,?? thought Quacker. Then suddenly"
4980 "he sat up very straight and looked with all his might. What under the"
4980 "sun was the matter with that Fox? She was acting as if she had suddenly"
4980 "lost her senses."
4980 ""
4980 "Over and over she rolled. Around and around she spun. She turned"
4980 "somersaults. She lay on her back and kicked her heels in the air. Never"
4980 "in his life had he known any one to act like that. There must be"
4980 "something the matter with her."
4980 ""
4980 "Quacker began to get excited. He couldn??t keep his eyes off Old Granny"
4980 "Fox. He began to swim nearer. He wanted to see better. He quite forgot"
4980 "she was a Fox. She moved so fast that she was just a queer red spot on"
4980 "the beach. Whatever she was doing was very curious and very exciting."
4980 "He swam nearer and nearer. The excitement was catching. He began to"
4980 "swim in circles himself. All the time he drew nearer and nearer to the"
4980 "shore. He didn??t have the least bit of fear. He was just curious. He"
4980 "wanted to see better."
4980 ""
4980 "All the time Granny was cutting up her antics, she was watching"
4980 "Quacker, though he didn??t suspect it. As he swam nearer and nearer to"
4980 "the shore, Granny rolled and tumbled farther and farther back. At last"
4980 "Quacker was close to the shore. If he kept on, he would be right on the"
4980 "land in a few minutes. And all the time he stared and stared. No"
4980 "thought of danger entered his head. You see, there was no room because"
4980 "it was so filled with curiosity."
4980 ""
4980 "??In a minute more I??ll have him,?? thought Granny, and whirled faster"
4980 "than ever. And just then something happened."

4980 ""
4980 "<CHAPTER V>"
4980 "Reddy Fox Is Afraid To Go Home"
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Yes, Sir, a chicken track is good to see, but it often puts nothing but"
4980 "water in my mouth."
4980 "          ??_Old Granny Fox_."
4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy Fox thought of that saying many times as he hunted through the"
4980 "Green Forest that night, afraid to go home. You see, he had almost"
4980 "dined on Quacker the Duck over at the Big River that day and then"
4980 "hadn??t, and it was all his own fault. That was why he was afraid to go"
4980 "home. From his hiding-place on the bank he had watched Quacker swim in"
4980 "and in until he was almost on the shore where old Granny Fox was"
4980 "whirling and rolling and tumbling about as if she had entirely lost her"
4980 "senses. Indeed, Reddy had been quite sure that she had when she began."
4980 "It wasn??t until he saw that curiosity was drawing Quacker right in so"
4980 "that in a minute or two Granny would be able to catch him, that he"
4980 "understood that Granny was anything but crazy, and really was teaching"
4980 "him a new trick as well as trying to catch a dinner."
4980 ""
4980 "When he realized this, he should have been ashamed of himself for"
4980 "doubting the smartness of Granny and for thinking that he knew all"
4980 "there was to know. But he was too much excited for any such thoughts."
4980 "Nearer and nearer to the shore came Quacker, his eyes fixed on the red,"
4980 "whirling form of Granny. Reddy??s own eyes gleamed with excitement."
4980 "Would Quacker keep on right up to the shore? Nearer and nearer and"
4980 "nearer he came. Reddy squirmed uneasily. He couldn??t see as well as he"
4980 "wanted to. The bushes behind which he was lying were in his way. He"
4980 "wanted to see Granny make that jump which would mean a dinner for both."
4980 ""
4980 "Forgetting what Granny had charged him, Reddy eagerly raised his head"
4980 "to look over the edge of the bank. Now it just happened that at that"
4980 "very minute Quacker chanced to look that way. His quick eyes caught the"
4980 "movement of Reddy??s head and in an instant all his curiosity vanished."
4980 "That sharp face peering at him over the edge of the bank could mean but"
4980 "one thing??danger! It was all a trick! He saw through it now. Like a"
4980 "flash he turned. There was the whistle of stiff wings beating the air"
4980 "and the patter of feet striking the water as he got under way. Then he"
4980 "flew out to the safety of the open water. Granny sprang, but she was"
4980 "just too late and succeeded in doing no more than wet her feet."
4980 ""
4980 "Of course, Granny didn??t know what had frightened Quacker, not at"
4980 "first, anyway. But she had her suspicions. She turned and looked up at"
4980 "the place where Reddy had been hiding. She couldn??t see him. Then she"
4980 "bounded up the bank. There was no Reddy there, but far away across the"
4980 "snow-covered Green Meadows was a red spot growing smaller and smaller."
4980 "Reddy was running away. Then she knew. At first Granny was very angry."
4980 "You know it is a dreadful thing to be hungry and have a good dinner"
4980 "disappear just as it is almost within reach."
4980 ""
4980 "??I??ll teach that young scamp a lesson he won??t soon forget when I get"
4980 "home,?? she muttered, as she watched him. Then she went back to the edge"
4980 "of the Big River and there she found a dead fish which had been washed"
4980 "ashore. It was a very good fish, and when she had eaten it Granny felt"
4980 "better."
4980 ""
4980 "??Anyway,?? thought she, ??I have taught him a new trick and one he is n??t"
4980 "likely to forget. He knows now that Granny still knows a few tricks"
4980 "that he doesn??t, and next time he won??t feel so sure he knows it all. I"
4980 "guess it was worth while even if I didn??t catch Quacker. My, but he"
4980 "would have tasted good!?? Granny smacked her lips and started for home."
4980 ""
4980 "But Reddy, with a guilty conscience, was afraid to go home. And so,"
4980 "miserable and hungry, he hunted through the Green Forest all the long"
4980 "night and wished and wished that he had heeded what old Granny Fox had"

4980 "He had been tramping through the Green Forest late in the afternoon and"

4980 "before, but of course she couldn??t take the print of her body with her."
4980 "That remained in the snow, and Farmer Brown??s boy saw it and knew"
4980 "instantly what it meant. He grinned, and could Granny Fox have seen"

4980 "long before Bowser??s great voice told all the Great World that he had"
4980 "found Granny??s tracks. Farmer Brown??s boy grinned just as he had the"

4980 "growing more and more excited as he followed Old Granny Fox. By and by"
4980 "Bowser stopped baying and began to yelp impatiently. Farmer Brown??s boy"
4980 "knew exactly what that meant. It meant that Granny had played one of"

4980 "A few minutes later out of the Green Forest came Old Granny Fox, and"

4980 "tired, she often slipped over there for a short nap and sun-bath even"

4980 "Pasture. It seemed very far away. She sighed wearily. ??I don??t believe"

4980 "Reddy turned and stared at Granny suspiciously. You know his is a very"

4980 "??Old bones don??t rest and recover as quickly as young bones, and I just"

4980 "When he left home to go to the Old Pasture, in the hope that he would"

4980 "head a memory of the shelter down in a far corner of the Old Orchard"
4980 "which Farmer Brown??s boy had built for Bob White. Probably the Bob"

4980 "Bob and all the young Bobs picking up grain which Farmer Brown??s boy"
4980 "had scattered for them just in front of the shelter he had built for"
4980 "them. Reddy crouched down and very slowly, an inch at a time, he crept"
4980 "forward, his eyes shining with eagerness. Just as he was almost within"
4980 "springing distance, Bob White gave a signal, and away flew the Bob"
4980 "Whites to the safety of a hemlock-tree on the edge of the Green Forest."

4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Bowser The Hound dearly loves to hunt just for the pleasure of the"

4980 "using that wonderful nose of his and the excitement of trying to catch"
4980 "some one, especially Granny or Reddy Fox. Farmer Brown??s boy had put"
4980 "away his dreadful gun because he no longer wanted to kill the little"
4980 "people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows, but rather to make"
4980 "them his friends. Bowser had missed the exciting hunts he used to enjoy"
4980 "so much with Farmer Brown??s boy. So Bowser had formed the habit of"
4980 "slipping away alone for a hunt every once in a while. When Farmer"
4980 "Brown??s boy discovered this, he got a chain and chained Bowser to his"
4980 "little house to keep him from running away and hunting on the sly."
4980 ""
4980 "Of course Bowser wasn??t kept chained all the time. Oh, my, no! When his"

4980 "Bowser with him, he would chain Bowser up. Now Bowser always had one"
4980 "good big meal a day. To be sure, he had scraps or a bone now and then"
4980 "besides, but once a day he had one good big meal served to him in a"
4980 "large tin pan. If he happened to be chained, it was brought out to him."
4980 "If not, it was given to him just outside the kitchen door."
4980 ""
4980 "Granny Fox knew all about this. Sly old Granny makes it her business to"
4980 "know the affairs of other people around her because there is no telling"
4980 "when such knowledge may be of use to her. So Granny had watched Bowser"
4980 "the Hound when he and his master had no idea at all that she was"
4980 "anywhere about, and she had found out his ways, the usual hour for his"
4980 "dinner and just how far that chain would allow him to go. It was such"
4980 "things which she had stored away in that shrewd old head of hers that"
4980 "made her so sure she and Reddy could take Bowser??s dinner away from"
4980 "him. It was just about Bowser??s dinner-time when Granny and Reddy"
4980 "trotted across the snow-covered fields and crept behind the barn until"
4980 "they could peep around the corner. No one was in sight, not even"

4980 "??You stay right here and watch until his dinner is brought out to him,??"

4980 "you and stay there until you see that I have got that dinner, or until"
4980 "you hear somebody coming, for you know Bowser will make a great racket."

4980 ""
4980 "So Reddy sat down to watch, and Granny left him. By and by Mrs. Brown"
4980 "came out of the house with a pan full of good things. She put it down"
4980 "in front of Bowser??s little house and called to him. Then she turned"
4980 "and hurried back, for it was very cold. Bowser came out of his little"
4980 "house, yawned and stretched lazily."
4980 ""
4980 "It was time for Reddy to do his part. Out he walked and sat down right"
4980 "in front of Bowser and grinned at him. Bowser stared for a minute as if"
4980 "he doubted his own eyes. Such impudence! Bowser growled. Then with a"
4980 "yelp he sprang towards Reddy."
4980 ""
4980 "Now the chain that held him was long, but Reddy had taken care not to"
4980 "get too near, and of course Bowser couldn??t reach him. He tugged with"
4980 "all his might and yelped and barked frantically, but Reddy just sat"
4980 "there and grinned in the most provoking manner. It was great fun to"

4980 "Meanwhile old Granny Fox had stolen out from around the corner of the"
4980 "shed behind Bowser. Getting hold of the edge of the pan with her teeth"
4980 "she pulled it back with her around the corner and out of sight. If she"
4980 "made any noise, Bowser didn??t hear it. He was making too much noise"
4980 "himself and was too excited. Presently Reddy heard the sound of an"
4980 "opening door. Mrs. Brown was coming to see what all the fuss was about."
4980 "Like a flash Reddy darted behind the barn, and all Mrs. Brown saw was"
4980 "Bowser tugging at his chain as he whined and yelped excitedly."
4980 ""
4980 "??I guess he must have seen a stray cat or something,?? said Mrs. Brown"
4980 "and went back in the house. Bowser continued to whine and tug at his"

4980 "better when he was scratching his ears. ??If they don??t get it in the"
4980 "night, and they certainly didn??t get anything this night, they must get"
4980 "it in the daytime. I??ve done considerable hunting myself in the"
4980 "daytime, and I haven??t once met them in the Green Forest or seen them"
4980 "on the Green Meadows or up in the Old Pasture. I wonder if they are"
4980 "stealing Farmer Brown??s hens and haven??t been found out yet. I??ve kept"
4980 "away from there myself, but if they can steal hens and not be caught, I"
4980 "certainly can. There never was a Fox yet smart enough to do a thing"
4980 "that a Coyote cannot do if he tries. I think I??ll slip up where I can"
4980 "watch Farmer Brown??s and see what is going on up there. Yes, Sir,"
4980 "that??s what I??ll do.??"
4980 ""
4980 "With this, Old Man Coyote grinned and then curled himself up for a"
4980 "short nap, for he was tired."

4980 ""
4980 ""
4980 "Listen and you shall hear all about three rogues. Two were in red and"
4980 "were Granny and Reddy Fox. And one was in gray and was Old Man Coyote."
4980 "They were the slyest, smartest rogues on all the Green Meadows or in"
4980 "all the Green Forest. All three had started out to steal the same"
4980 "dinner, but the funny part is they didn??t intend to steal it from the"
4980 "same person. And still funnier is it that one of them didn??t even know"
4980 "where that dinner was or what kind of a dinner it would be."
4980 ""
4980 "True to his resolve to know what Granny and Reddy Fox were getting to"
4980 "eat, and where they were getting it, Old Man Coyote hid where he could"
4980 "see what was going on about Farmer Brown??s, for it was there he felt"
4980 "sure that Granny and Reddy were getting food. He had waited only a"
4980 "little while when along came Granny and Reddy Fox past the place where"
4980 "Old Man Coyote was hiding. They didn??t see him. Of course not. He took"
4980 "care that they should have no chance. But anyway, they were not"
4980 "thinking of him. Their thoughts were all of that dinner they intended"
4980 "to have, and the smart trick by which they would get it."
4980 ""
4980 "So with their thoughts all on that dinner they slipped up behind the"
4980 "barn and prepared to work the trick which had been so successful"
4980 "before. Old Man Coyote crept after them. He saw Reddy Fox lie down"
4980 "where he could peep around the corner of the barn to watch Bowser the"
4980 "Hound and to see that no one else was about. He saw Granny leave Reddy"
4980 "there and hurry away. Old Man Coyote??s wits worked fast."
4980 ""
4980 "??I can??t be in two places at once,?? thought he, ??so I can??t watch both"
4980 "Granny and Reddy. As I can watch but one, which one shall it be?"
4980 "Granny, of course. Granny is the smartest of the two, and whatever they"
4980 "are up to, she is at the bottom of it. Granny is the one to follow.??"
4980 ""
4980 "So, like a gray shadow, crafty Old Man Coyote stole after Granny Fox"
4980 "and saw her hide behind the corner of the shed at the end of which was"
4980 "the little house of Bowser the Hound. He crept as near as he dared and"
4980 "then lay flat down behind a little bunch of dead grass close to the"
4980 "shed. For some time nothing happened, and Old Man Coyote was puzzled."
4980 "Every once in a while Granny Fox would look behind and all about to be"
4980 "sure that no danger was near, but she didn??t see Old Man Coyote. After"
4980 "what seemed to him a long time, he heard a door open on the other side"
4980 "of the shed. It was Mrs. Brown carrying Bowser??s dinner out to him. Of"
4980 "course, Old Man Coyote didn??t know this. He knew by the sounds that"
4980 "some one had come out of the house, and it made him nervous. He didn??t"
4980 "like being so close to Farmer Brown??s house in broad daylight. But he"
4980 "kept his eyes on Granny Fox, and he saw her ears prick up in a way that"
4980 "he knew meant that those sounds were just what she had been waiting"
4980 "for."
4980 ""
4980 "??If she isn??t afraid, I don??t need to be,?? thought he craftily. After a"
4980 "few minutes he heard a door close and knew that whoever had come out"
4980 "had gone back into the house. Almost at once Bowser the Hound began to"
4980 "yelp and whine. Swiftly Granny Fox disappeared around the corner of the"
4980 "shed. Just as swiftly Old Man Coyote ran forward and peeped around the"
4980 "corner. There was Bowser the Hound tugging at his chain, and just"
4980 "beyond his reach was Reddy Fox, grinning in the most provoking manner."
4980 "And there was Granny Fox, backing and dragging after her Bowser??s"
4980 "dinner. In a flash Old Man Coyote understood the plan, and he almost"
4980 "chuckled aloud at the cleverness of it. Then he hastily backed behind"
4980 "the shed and waited. In a minute Granny Fox appeared, dragging Bowser??s"
4980 "dinner. She was so intent on getting that dinner that she almost backed"
4980 "into Old Man Coyote without suspecting that he was anywhere about."
4980 ""
4980 "??Thank you, Granny. You needn??t bother about it any longer; I??ll take"
4980 "it now,?? growled Old Man Coyote in Granny??s ear."
4980 ""
4980 "Granny let go of that dinner as if it burned her tongue, and with a"
4980 "frightened little yelp leaped to one side. A minute later Reddy came"
4980 "racing around from behind the barn eager for his share. What he saw was"
4980 "Old Man Coyote bolting down that twice-stolen dinner while Granny Fox"
4980 "fairly danced with rage."

4980 "ever I have seen. It was quite worthy of a Coyote. You are a very"

4980 "suggest that it will be better for all concerned if we are not seen"
4980 "about here.??"
4980 ""
4980 "He darted off behind the barn like a gray streak, and Granny and Reddy"
4980 "followed, for it was true that some one was coming. You see Bowser the"

4980 "??Sure! But it??s always closed at night,?? snapped Reddy. ??Besides, to"

4980 "??Nothing much, only if that hen-yard gate should _happen_ to be left"

4980 "Farmer Brown??s boy _doesn??t_ close the henyard gate at night. I suppose"
4980 "he thinks that if the henhouse door is locked, the gate doesn??t matter."
4980 "Any one who is careless about one thing, is likely to be careless about"
4980 "another. Sometime he may forget to close that hole. I told you that we"
4980 "would try for one of those hens to-morrow morning, but the more I think"
4980 "about it, the more I think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a"
4980 "few nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in broad"
4980 "daylight. In fact, I am pretty sure I can make Farmer Brown??s boy"
4980 "forget to close that gate.??"

4980 "Granny grinned. ??I??ll try it first and tell you afterwards,?? said she."

4980 "as noiselessly as shadows. They heard Bowser the Hound sighing in his"
4980 "sleep in his snug little house, and grinned at each other. Silently"
4980 "they stole over to the henyard. The gate was open, just as Granny had"
4980 "told Reddy it would be. Across the henyard they trotted swiftly,"
4980 "straight to where more than once in the daytime they had seen the hens"
4980 "come out of the house through a little hole. It was closed. Reddy had"

4980 "Then she noticed that at one edge there was a tiny crack. She tried to"
4980 "push her nose through, but the crack was too narrow. Then she tried a"
4980 "paw. A claw caught on the edge of the door, and it moved ever so"
4980 "little. Then Granny knew that the little door wasn??t fastened. Granny"
4980 "stretched herself flat on the ground and went to work, first with one"
4980 "paw, then with the other. By and by she caught her claws in it just"
4980 "right again, and it moved a wee bit more. No, most certainly that door"
4980 "wasn??t fastened, and that crack was a little wider."
4980 ""
4980 "??What are you wasting your time there for??? demanded Reddy crossly."
4980 "??We??d better be off hunting if we would have anything to eat this"
4980 "night.??"

4980 "Granny said nothing but kept on working. She had discovered that this"
4980 "was a sliding door. Presently the crack was wide enough for her to get"
4980 "her nose in. Then she pushed and twisted her head this way and that."
4980 "The little door slowly slid back, and when Reddy turned to speak to her"
4980 "again, for he had had his back to her, she was nowhere to be seen."
4980 "Reddy just gaped and gaped foolishly. There was no Granny Fox, but"
4980 "there was a black hole where she had been working, and from it came the"
4980 "most delicious smell,??the smell of fat hens! It seemed to Reddy that"
4980 "his stomach fairly flopped over with longing. He rubbed his eyes to be"
4980 "sure that he was awake. Then in a twinkling he was inside that hole"
4980 "himself."

4980 "the night, or at any other time, for that matter. That is, they had no"
4980 "business to be there, as Farmer Brown would look at the matter. He"

4980 "the henhouse was a sort of storehouse. It would have made no difference"
4980 "if it had. Among the little people it is considered quite right to help"
4980 "yourself from another??s storehouse if you are smart enough to find it"

4980 "Besides, Reddy and Granny knew that Fanner Brown and his boy would eat"

4980 "nothing wrong in being in that henhouse in the middle of the night."
4980 "They were there simply because they needed food very, very much, and"
4980 "food was there."
4980 ""
4980 "They stared up at the roosts where the biddies were huddled together,"
4980 "fast asleep. They were too high up to be reached from the floor even"

4980 "??We??ve got to wake them up and scare them so that some of the silly"
4980 "things will fly down where we can catch them,?? said Reddy, licking his"
4980 "lips hungrily."
4980 ""
4980 "??That won??t do at all!?? snapped Granny. ??They would make a great racket"
4980 "and waken Bowser the Hound, and he would waken his master, and that is"
4980 "just what we mustn??t do if we hope to ever get in here again. I thought"
4980 "you had more sense, Reddy.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy looked a little shamefaced. ??Well, if we don??t do that, how are"

4980 "??You stay right here where you are,?? snapped Granny, ??and take care"
4980 "that you don??t make a sound.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Then Granny jumped lightly to a little shelf that ran along in front of"
4980 "the nesting boxes. From this she could reach the lower roost on which"
4980 "four fat hens were asleep. Very gently she pushed her head in between"
4980 "two of these and crowded them apart. Sleepily they protested and moved"
4980 "along a little. Granny continued to crowd them. At last one of them"
4980 "stretched out her head to see who was crowding so. Like a flash Granny"
4980 "seized that head, and biddy never knew what had wakened her, nor did"
4980 "she have a chance to waken the others."
4980 ""
4980 "Dropping this hen at Reddy??s feet, Granny crowded another until she did"
4980 "the same thing, and just the same thing happened once more. Then Granny"
4980 "jumped lightly down, picked up one of the hens by the neck, slung the"
4980 "body over her shoulder, and told Reddy to do the same with the other"
4980 "and start for home."
4980 ""
4980 "??Aren??t you going to get any more while we have the chance??? grumbled"
4980 "Reddy."
4980 ""
4980 "??Enough is enough,?? retorted Granny. ??We??ve got a dinner for two, and"
4980 "so far no one is any the wiser. Perhaps these two won??t be missed, and"
4980 "we??ll have a chance to get some more another night. Now come on.??"
4980 ""
4980 "This was plain common sense, and Reddy knew it, so without another word"

4980 "??Ha!?? said he presently, and held up two red hairs which he had found"
4980 "on the edge of the door. ??Ha! I thought as much. I was careless last"

4980 "suppose it serves me right for my carelessness, and I suppose if the"

4980 "ever could have been to me, because the poor fellow must be having"
4980 "pretty hard work to get a living these hard winter days. Still, I can??t"
4980 "have him stealing any more. That would never do at all. If I shut them"

4980 "will happen, and I might do just as I did last night??think I had locked"
4980 "up when I hadn??t. I don??t like to set a trap for Reddy, but I must"
4980 "teach the rascal a lesson. If I don??t, he will get so bold that those"
4980 "chickens won??t be safe even in broad daylight.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Now at just that very time over in their home, Granny and Reddy Fox"
4980 "were talking over plans for the future, and shrewd old Granny was"
4980 "pointing out to Reddy how necessary it was that they should keep away"
4980 "from that henyard for some time. ??We??ve had a good dinner, a splendid"
4980 "dinner, and if we are smart enough we may be able to get more good"
4980 "dinners where this one came from,?? said she. ??But we certainly won??t if"
4980 "we are too greedy.??"
4980 ""
4980 "??But I don??t believe Farmer Brown??s boy has missed those two chickens,"
4980 "and I don??t see any reason at all why we shouldn??t go back there"

4980 "??Maybe he hasn??t missed those two, but if we should take two more he"
4980 "certainly would miss them, and he would guess what had become of them,"

4980 "not starving now, and the best thing for us to do is to keep away from"

4980 "mind what I tell you, Reddy, and don??t you dare go near there.??"
4980 ""
4980 "Reddy promised, and so it came about that Farmer Brown??s boy hunted up"
4980 "a trap all for nothing so far as Reddy and Granny were concerned. Very"
4980 "carefully he bound strips of cloth around the jaws of the trap, for he"
4980 "couldn??t bear to think of those cruel jaws cutting into the leg of"
4980 "Reddy, should he happen to get caught. You see, Farmer Brown??s boy"
4980 "didn??t intend to kill Reddy if he should catch him, but to make him a"
4980 "prisoner for a while and so keep him out of mischief. That night he hid"
4980 "the trap very cunningly just inside the henhouse where any one creeping"
4980 "through that little hole made for the hens to go in and out would be"
4980 "sure to step in it. Then he purposely left the little sliding door open"
4980 "part way as if it had been forgotten, and he also left the henyard gate"
4980 "open just as he had done the night before."

4980 "??There now, Master Reddy,?? said he, talking to himself, ??I rather think"

4980 "hunter. He was so sore he could hardly walk, and could not go very far."
4980 "So old Granny Fox had led him to the old deserted house and put him to"

4980 "No, Reddy Fox did not like the Old Pasture at all. There was no long,"

4980 "missed the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest."
4980 "There was no one to bully and tease. And it was such a long, long way"

4980 "The truth is, wise old Granny Fox knew that the very best thing she"

4980 "sore to travel such a long way, and she hoped that by the time Reddy"
4980 "was well enough to go, he would have learned better than to do such a"

4980 "a little knoll, which you know is a little low hill, right where they"
4980 "could sit on their doorstep and look all over the Green Meadows. It had"
4980 "been very, very beautiful down there. They had made lovely little paths"
4980 "through the tall green meadow grass, and the buttercups and daisies had"
4980 "grown close up to their very doorstep. But up here in the Old Pasture"
4980 "Granny Fox had chosen the thickest clump of bushes and young trees she"
4980 "could find, and in the middle was a great pile of rocks. Way in among"
4980 "these rocks Granny Fox had dug their new house. It was right down under"
4980 "the rocks. Even in the middle of the day jolly, round, red Mr. Sun"
4980 "could hardly find it with a few of his long, bright beams. All the rest"

4980 "And here we will leave wise Old Granny Fox and Reddy, safe, even if"
4980 "they do not like their new home. You see, Lightfoot the Deer is getting"
